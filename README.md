## Abstract

The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has become dominant in most countries and has raised significant global health concerns. As a global commerce center, New York City constantly faces the risk of multiple variant introductions of SARS-CoV-2. To elucidate the introduction and transmission of the Omicron variant in New York City, we created a comprehensive genomic and epidemiologic analysis of 392 Omicron viruses collected between November 25, 2021 and December 11, 2021. We found evidence of four independent introductions of Omicron subclades, including the Omicron subclade BA.1.1 with defining substitution of R346K in the S protein. The continuous genetic divergence within each Omicron subclade revealed their local community transmission and co-circulation in New York City, including both household and workplace transmissions supported by epidemiological evidence. Our observation highlights the urgent need for enhanced genomic surveillance and effective response planning for better prevention and management of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

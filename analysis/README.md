# Data

The global context SARS-CoV-2 genomes used in this research were downloaded from [GISAID](https://gisaid.org/). We gratefully acknowledge GISAID and all the authors, originating and submitting laboratories of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences for sharing their work in open databases.

In adhering to GISAID Terms of Use, we are not allowed to re-share these sequences and so this data is not present in the repository. Instead, we provide the EPI_SET Identifier (EPI_SET_220830zq) for these context sequences.

# Nextclade

[Nextclade](https://clades.nextstrain.org/) was used for sequence alignment, mutation calling, Nextstrain clade assignment, and quality control for SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

To get nextclade sars-cov-2 dataset, run

```
sh scripts/get_nextclade_dataset.sh
```

To analyze 392 omicron sars-cov-2 sequences in New York City, run

```
sh scripts/run_nextclade_nyc.sh
```

To analyze global context sars-cov-2 sequences, run

```
sh scripts/run_nextclade_global.sh
```

# Figure

To plot figures or prepare data for plotting figures in our manuscript, please see scripts in the `scripts` directory.

The figures were manually beautified after being generated by these scripts/nextstrain workflow/gephi.
